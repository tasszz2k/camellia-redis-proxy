## Control the number of client connections
* camellia-redis-proxy supports configuring the upper limit of the number of connections on the client side (supports the global number of connections, and also supports bid/bgroup level)
* camellia-redis-proxy supports configuration to close idle client connections (this function may cause abnormal client requests with a small number of requests, configure it carefully)

## Configure the maximum number of client connections
### Principle
* The proxy provides ConnectLimiter to configure the maximum number of client connections. You can customize the implementation of the ConnectLimiter interface (for example, dynamically obtain the configuration of the maximum number of connections from the business configuration center), and configure the full class name in application.yaml or use spring Automatic injection is enabled
* The configuration of the maximum number of connections is obtained by reading the related configuration of camellia-redis-proxy.properties, which supports dynamic changes
* When the global maximum number of connections is triggered, the new client connection will be closed directly; when the maximum number of connections at the bid/bgroup level is triggered, commands such as AUTH/CLIENT/HELLO will be executed on the new connection to bind bid/bgroup returns an error message and closes the connection

camellia-redis-proxy.properties is configured as follows (unlimited by default):
````
#Configure the global maximum connection limit, if it is less than 0, it means no limit
max.client.connect=100000

#Configure the maximum number of connections for a bid/bgroup:
#Indicates the maximum number of connections belonging to bid=1, bgroup=default, if it is less than 0, it means no limit
1.default.max.client.connect=10000
````

## Configure to detect/close idle client connections
### Principle
* The IdleStateHandler provided by netty is used to detect idle client connections. If it is configured to close when idle, the idle client connections will be forcibly closed by the server
* When the client connection uses the subscribe/psubscribe command to subscribe, the idle connection will not be closed, but the idle connection log will be printed
* This function may cause abnormal client requests with a small number of requests, please use it with caution

### Configuration example
````yaml
server:
  port: 6380
spring:
  application:
    name: camellia-redis-proxy-server

camellia-redis-proxy:
  password: pass123
  netty:
    reader-idle-time-seconds: 600 #Only if all three parameters are greater than or equal to 0, the idle connection detection will be enabled
    writer-idle-time-seconds: 0 #Only if all three parameters are greater than or equal to 0, the idle connection detection will be enabled
    all-idle-time-seconds: 0 #Only if all three parameters are greater than or equal to 0, the idle connection detection will be enabled
  transpond:
    type: local
    local:
      resource: redis://@127.0.0.1:6379
````
The above example means to enable idle connection detection. When a connection does not have any readable data within 600s, it is determined as an idle connection, and a log will be printed at this time. If you need to close the idle connection, you need to be in camellia-redis-proxy.properties Configuration, configuration supports dynamic changes:
````
#Whether the idle connection is closed when the reader-idle event is triggered, the default is false
##Global configuration
reader.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true
##bid/bgroup level configuration, the priority is higher than the global configuration
1.default.reader.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true

#Whether the idle connection is closed when the writer-idle event is triggered, the default is false
##Global configuration
writer.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true
##bid/bgroup level configuration, the priority is higher than the global configuration
1.default.writer.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true

#Whether the idle connection is closed when the all-idle event is triggered, the default is false
all.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true
##bid/bgroup level configuration, the priority is higher than the global configuration
1.default.all.idle.client.connection.force.close.enable=true
